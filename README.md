# Using R as a Research Tool: Part 1

The repository contains information for the course **Using R as a Research Tool** for the NERC E4 DTP at the University of Edinburgh.

This is the first of two sessions to demonstrate how to create a basic research workflow in R, which will cover:


* Introduction to R and RStudio.
* Creating and structuring an R Project
* Reading in and managing data.
* Data visualisation with ggplot2.

As the course is online this year, we will trial the use of a `learnr` tutorial. This can be run by opening `Intro_to_R.Rproj` in RStudio and then doing the following:

1. Open `Tutorial_E4_Introduction_to_R.Rmd`
2. Click on the Cog above the top left hand window and select "Preview in Viewer Pane"
3. Click "Run Document"
